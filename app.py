        text = ''' Although Congress instructed the Attorney General in 1994 to compile and publish annual statistics 
        on police use of excessive force, this was never carried out, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation does not collect these data. 
        The annual average number of justifiable homicides alone was previously estimated to be near 400. 
        Updated estimates from the Bureau of Justice Statistics released in 2015 estimate the number to be around 930 per year, 
        or 1,240 if assuming that non-reporting local agencies kill people at the same rate as reporting agencies.A 2019 study by Esposito, Lee, and Edwards 
        states that police killings are a leading cause of death for men aged 25â€“29 at 1.8 per 100000, trailing causes such as accidental death (76.6 per 100000), suicide (26.7 per 100000), and other homicides (22.0 per 100000).
        Around 2015â€“2016, The Guardian newspaper ran its own database, The Counted, which tracked US killings by police and other law enforcement agencies including from gunshots, tasers, car accidents and custody deaths. 
        They counted 1,146 deaths for 2015 and 1,093 deaths for 2016. The database can be viewed by state, gender, race/ethnicity, 
        age, classification (e.g., "gunshot"), and whether the person killed was armed.
        The Washington Post has tracked shootings since 2015, reporting more than 5,000 incidents since their tracking began.The database can also classify people in various categories including race, age, weapon etc. For 2019, it reported a total of 1,004 people shot and killed by police.According to the database, 6,600 have been killed since 2015, including 6,303 men and 294 women. Among those killed, 3,878 were armed with a gun, 1,119 were armed with a knife, 218 were armed with a vehicle, 244 had a toy weapon, and 421 were unarmed.
        A research brief by the Police Integrity Research Group of Bowling Green State University found that between 2005 and 2019, 104 nonfederal law enforcement officers had been arrested for murder or manslaughter for an on-duty shooting. As of 2019, 80 cases cases had concluded, with 35 leading to convictions, though often on lesser charges; 18 were convicted of manslaughter and four were convicted of murder.
        According to an article in The Lancet, between 1980 and 2018, more than 30,000 were killed by the police.The study estimated that 55.5% the deaths were incorrectly classified in the U.S. National Vital Statistics System, which tracks information from death certificates.Death certificates do not require coroners to list whether the police were involved in the death which may contribute to the disparity.
